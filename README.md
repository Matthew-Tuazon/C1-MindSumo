# Capital One Summit Challenge
Built by <a href = "matthew-tuazon.github.io">Matthew Tuazon.</a>

This is my first project extensively working within Python. I was able to expose myself to new technologies such as Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas, as well as further my understanding within HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Bootstrap.

The following is my planning for the challenge. 
Challenge: <a href = "https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/bikeshare-data">https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/bikeshare-data</a>

## Challenge Requirements: 
1. Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from data set that's interesting to me. [x]
2. Which Start/Stop stations are popular. [x]
3. Average distance traveled with bikes. [x]
4. How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute. [x]

## Side-Quests:
1. How does ridership change with seasons? (Passes used, duration, etc...) [x]
2. Is there a net change of bikes throughout the day? When and where should bikes be transported to make sure bikes match travel patterns? [ ]
3. What's the breakdown of Trip Route Category-Passholder type combinations? What might make a particular combination more popular? [x]

## What I used:
* Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebook, and Python3 for Computations.
* Bootstrap, CanvasJS, JavaScript, HTML/CSS for Front-End.
* Referenced <a href = "https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/"> Metro Bike Share</a> Station Table.
